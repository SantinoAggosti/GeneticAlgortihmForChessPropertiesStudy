# CHESS PROPERTIES: Genetic Algorithm Analysis

Through the implementation of a genetic algorithm, chess properties are analyzed and explored, while effectively demostrating convergence towards local and pseudo global maxima in multiple maximization problems.
The following is a description of the internal workings of these algorithm. Taking in consideration future changes for enhanced performance through recent breakthroughs in genetic algorithms.
